<p> "Magic the Gathering is a strategic trading card game created by Richard Garfield in 1993. The Game revolves around playing land cards to generate resources to summon creatures and cast spells. The objective of the game is to reduce your opponent's life to zero to win the game. There are over 27000 unique cards to play with that interact with each other in different ways. The cards are divided into 5 different colors which favor different playstyles and deck building paths. The game is heavily inspired from high fantasy influences such as dungeons and dragons and the works of Tolkien.  " </p>
