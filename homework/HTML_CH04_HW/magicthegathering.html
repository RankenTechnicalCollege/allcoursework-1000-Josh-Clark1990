    <h1>Magic The Gathering</h1>
    <p style="color: rgb(214, 17, 17)"> Magic the Gathering is a strategic card game created by Richard Garfield in 1993. The game revolves around a system of 5 colors; white, blue, black, red, green. Each color has their own play style, strengths and weaknesses. The game is played using a 60 card deck including land cards and any combination of creatures, instants, sorceries, artifacts, enchantments, planeswalkers, and battle cards. Land cards are used to provide resources called mana, which you use to play your cards. The game ends when a player's life total is reduced to 0, a player goes to draw a card but has no cards in their deck, or an alternate win condition is met. The game has over 27,000 unique cards spanning over 30 years of the game's history. The game was created with heavy influence from high fantasy influences like Dungeons and Dragons and Lord of the Rings.

  <div class="container">
      <ul>
        <li> Standard: A format using cards from the most recent sets from the last 2 years of the game. Cards and sets rotate out of the format after a certain amount of time has passed. Decks contain a minimum of 60 cards</li>
        <li> Modern: A non-rotating 60 card format featuring cards from 8th Edition and cards from each standard set released since, with the exception of a list of cards banned in the format. This format is one of the more competitive formats of the game, many major tournaments use this format for their competitions. </li>
        <li> Legacy: A non-rotating 60 card format with access to every card released since the game first started with the exception of cards banned in the format.</li>
        <li> Vintage: A non-rotating 60 card format with access to every card in the game, similar to legacy except certain cards are limited to 1 copy per deck instead of being banned. Format is less played due to secondary market prices of older cards legal in the format. Many cards are on a thing called the reserved list, which is a list of cards that Wizards of the Coast has said to never reprint.  </li>
        <li> EDH or Commander: This format is a 100 card format with deck building restrictions. You choose a legendary creature to act as your commander and your deck is limited to only using cards in the same color as the commander and only 1 of each card is allowed per deck with the exception of basic lands. You start at 40 life instead of 20 and the format is typically a 4 player format. This format is the most commonly played version of Magic due to the more casual friendly nature of the format.</li>
        <li> Pauper: This is a 60 card format that has access to every card in the game with the limitation that only cards of common rarity are allowed. The format also has its own banlist to help balance out the format. This format is the most budget friendly way to get into competitive Magic.  </li>
      </ul>
