    <p class="paragraph">
      Prior to the One Year War, Anaheim produced numerous goods for both the Earth Sphere and the colonies from cosmetics, vacation traveling plans and credit cards to consumer electronics, battleships and even space colonies. What role they played in the One Year War is unknown, though documents suggest that the RX-77-1A Guncannon A and the RX-78-2 Gundam were designed here at the direction of Tem Ray.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Following the One Year War, Anaheim was able to acquire the defense corporations of the defeated Principality of Zeon - Zimmad, Zeonic and MIP - along with their various designers and engineers. This allowed Anaheim to enter the lucrative business of Mobile Suit design and construction. The company was tapped by the Earth Federation to help in the rebuilding of their military forces and to design the next generation of Mobile Suits, leading to the creation of the Gundam Development Project in Universal Century 0083. The resulting incident involving the Mobile Suits, known as "Operation Stardust" would prove to be a black eye for the company, but they were able to recover, remaining in the Mobile Suit development business.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      In U.C. 0086, Anaheim became involved in the Gryps War, acting as one of the backers of the upstart Anti Earth Union Group. Thanks to secret help from the incognito Char Aznable, they would be provided with enhanced variations of the iconic Luna Titanium Alloy and the capture of the RX-178 Gundam Mk-II thanks to Kamille Bidan, they would be provided the Movable Frame, allowing them to create not only the mass produced MSA-003 Nemo, but also enhance Project Zeta, allowing for the kind of transformable mobile suits that were attempted with the MSN-001 Delta Gundam and fully realized with the MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam. The Titans, whom Anaheim outwardly also supported under the guise of acting as a neutral party, began suspecting the company's support of the AEUG, but was pacified by the RMS-108 Marasai, which Anaheim had originally planned to give to the AEUG.

Following the Gryps War, the company would both be involved in the Pezun Rebellion and the First Neo Zeon War, with many descendants of Project Zeta being used in both wars.

Char's Rebellion/Second Neo Zeon War
Following the conflicts of the late U.C. 0080s, Anaheim became the Earth Federation's premiere mobile suit producer, creating the RGM-89 Jegan to help replace the tried and true GM line. However, what the Federation didn't know was that they were also aiding Char Aznable's Newborn Neo Zeon movement, leading to the outbreak of the Second Neo Zeon War. To this end, Char allowed Anaheim to reveal the existence of the Psycho-Frame so that his rival Amuro Ray would not have a sub-par mobile suit for their fated duel.
