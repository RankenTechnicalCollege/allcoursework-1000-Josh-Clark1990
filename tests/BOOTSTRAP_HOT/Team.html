          <p class="card-text bg-info">O'Sullivan was in charge of the office and headquarters on the moon in the city of Van Bruan. While he openly supported the Earth Federation he was more than happy to make deals with Zeon, including Lieutenant Command Cima Garahau, who played a major role in Operation Stardust. Following the outcome of Operation Stardust, O'Sullivan was found dead in his office, having apparently shot himself in the head rather than be arrested for his implications in the Zeon uprising. However, he had a horrified look on his face when he died, implying that his death may have been a murder made to look like a suicide. </p>
